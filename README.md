# Microsoft and Movies

## Quick Overview
<img src='images/microsoftlogo.png' width=250 height=250 align='left'></img>
We want Microsoft to enter the movie business. However, it is hard to pinpoint a good starting place.
Thus, using data sets given to me, I will help pinpoint what are currently the most popular genres according
to the data. From there, I will look at which genres bring in the highest gross amounts.
Then I will look at a list of studios that are doing well in each genre. I will
decide from these lists which studios I would recommend to consult because they would be doing will in multiple
genres, as well as doing well on a domestic and foreign market.

## The Data
We are working with datasets from IMDB, Box Office Mojo, and The Numbers. However, these sets need cleaning for any missing values
or values formatted incorrectly. We will try to fill in the gaps from one another and then go through a process to make sure studios are 
listed correctly and the data is in the type we need.

## Our Questions

We will try to answer the following questions the best we can from the available dataframes.
1. Which genres are the current, most popular genres?
2. Why these genres?
3. Which top 5 studios are doing the best for each genre?
4. Of the studios listed for each genre, which 3 are doing well in domestic markets? Foreign markets?

analyzing data. There will be comments explaining each step I took to find our results.
