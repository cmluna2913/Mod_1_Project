# Microsoft and Movies
## Quick Overview
We want Microsoft to enter the movie business. However, it is hard to pinpoint a good starting place.
Thus, using data sets given to me, I will help pinpoint what are currently the top 3 genres according
to the data. From there, I will look at a list of studios that are doing well in each genre. Then I will
decide from these lists which studios I would recommend to consult because they would be doing will in multiple
genres.

## The Data
We are working with datasets from IMDB, Box Office Mojo, and The Numbers. However, these sets need cleaning for any missing or wrong
values. We will try to fill in the gaps from one another and then go through a process to make sure studios are 
listed correctly and the data is in the type we need.

## Our Questions
We will try to answer the following questions the best we can from the available dataframes.
1. Which genres are the current, most popular genres?
2. Why these genres?
3. Which top 5 studios are doing the best for each genre?
4. Of the studios listed for each genre, which 3 are doing well in domestic markets? Foreign markets?

## Included Files
The included files in this repository are pictures of the figures we obtained from our analysis.
The other file is an ipynb file where we go through merging dataframes, cleaning data, and then
analyzing data. There will be comments explaining each step I took to find our results.
